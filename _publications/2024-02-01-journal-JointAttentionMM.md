excerpt: 'Numerous computer-based collaborative learning environments have been developed to support collaborative problem-solving. Yet, understanding the complexity and dynamic nature of the collaboration process remains a challenge. This is particularly true in open-ended immersive learning environments, where students navigate both physical and virtual spaces, pursuing diverse paths to solve problems. In response, we aimed to unpack these complex collaborative learning processes by investigating 16 groups of college students (n = 77) who utilized an immersive astronomy simulation in their introductory astronomy course. Our specific focus is on joint attention as a multi-level indicator to index collaboration. To examine the interplay between joint attention and other multimodal traces (conceptual discussions and gestures) in students interactions with peers and the simulation, we employed a multi-granular approach. This approach encompasses macro-level correlations, meso-level network trends, and micro-level qualitative insights from vignettes to capture nuances at different levels. Distinct multimodal engagement patterns emerged between low- and high-achieving groups, evolving over time across a series of tasks. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the notion of timely joint attention and emphasize the importance of individual exploration during the early stages of collaborative problem-solving, demonstrating its contribution to productive knowledge co-construction. This research overall provides valuable insights into the complexities of collaboration dynamics within and beyond digital space. The empirical evidence we present in our study lays a strong foundation for developing instructional designs aimed at fostering productive collaboration in immersive learning environments.'
