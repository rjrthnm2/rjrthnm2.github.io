I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the department of Curriculum and Instruction, DELTA program at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I'm currently working with my advisor [Dr. Emma Mercier](https://education.illinois.edu/faculty/emma-mercier) and co-advised by [Dr. Jina Kang](https://education.illinois.edu/faculty/jina-kang). My background is in mechanical engineering and education. My research interests broadly focus on collaborative learning in engineering classroom contexts. I am deeply immersed in exploring the frontiers of collaborative learning and multi-modal learning analytics. My journey from engineering to curriculum instruction was sparked by the challenges I observed in discussion classrooms during my teaching assistantship. The engineer in me was drawn to solving the intricate problems of educational dynamics, particularly how discussions unfold in engineering settings. This curiosity led me to cross paths with my current advisor, who was investigating these very issues, marking the beginning of my transition and setting the stage for my research in educational innovation.

Transitioning from Mechanical Engineering to Curriculum and Instruction, I have been fascinated by the mechanics of learning environments and the potential of analytics to transform educational experiences. This interdisciplinary approach has enabled me to lead and contribute to groundbreaking projects such as [CSTEPS (Collaborative Sketch Tools for Engineering Problem Solving)](https://www.colearnlab.org/csteps), [CEASAR (Connections of Earth and Sky with Augmented Reality)](https://emit.education.illinois.edu/projects/ceasar), and HoloOrbits.

Highlighted Projects
======

1. CSTEPS, a tool designed to facilitate collaborative problem-solving among undergraduate engineering students, has been a focus of my research. 
1. CEASAR, an AR simulation of the night sky, helps astronomy undergraduates determine their location, fostering a deeper engagement with the material. 
1. HoloOrbits, aimed at middle and high school students, utilizes AR to teach Kepler's laws, making complex concepts accessible and engaging.

Research vision
======

My research primarily focuses on understanding the dynamics of small group learning, with an emphasis on how multi-modal learning analytics can be leveraged to optimize collaboration and educational outcomes. Looking ahead, I am eager to further explore the integration of engineering principles in educational research, with the ultimate goal of devising innovative solutions that can address the challenges of modern learning environments. I am committed to contributing to a future where technology and education converge to create more engaging, effective, and accessible learning experiences for all.
